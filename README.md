# Jekyll based blog
This is the code for the website / blogging platform I've been using. It's based on [http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/](So Simple Theme), which is awesome and well explained. 

The engine underneath is [http://jekyllrb.com/](jekyll) - a Ruby on Rails static website generator tool primarily used for blogs. It's also the default for GitHub Pages. 

As you are probably aware seeing as how you are reading this file - I have this all hosted for free on GitHub pages. Which is *absurdly* good. It's free for all static content (no PHP etc), and has no apparent limit on anything.  

Feel free to use all of this stuff and do whatever you like with it.
