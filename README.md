# Jekyll based blog
This is the code for the website / blogging platform for Rupert Dance. It's based on [So Simple Theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/), which is both awesome and well explained. 

The engine underneath is [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a Ruby on Rails static website generator tool primarily used for blogs. It's also the default for GitHub Pages. 

As you are probably aware seeing as how you are reading this file - I have this all hosted for free on GitHub pages. Which is *absurdly* good. It's free for all static content (no PHP etc), and has no apparent limit on anything. 

The contents of the _posts/ and thumbs/ directories remain the intellectual property of Cameron Moon.

Feel free to use the rest of the source and do whatever you like with it.

If you by chance find something slightly wrong, terribly wrong or just misspelled. Let me know with a pull request.
