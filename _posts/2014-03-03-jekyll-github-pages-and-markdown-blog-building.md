#Or, how I built this

### A Jekyll based blog

The engine underneath is [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - a Ruby on Rails static website generator tool primarily used for blogs. It's also the default for GitHub Pages. 

It's based on the [So Simple Theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/), which is itself quite awesome and has some in-depth documentation to ease you in. 

I fell back on [this handy tutorial from 24ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) which was a good step by step for those not familiar with github pages and/or jekyll.

I have this all hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**. Which is *absurdly* good. It's free for all static content (no PHP etc), and has no real limit on anything.  

Feel free to see how it all works under the hood [on github](https://github.com/rupertdance/rupert-site).

###Why Jekyll + GitHub Pages?

I needed a way to structure and organise my web development endeavours that let me know I was learning and doing something useful. I'm working part-time at the moment and I not want for time. It turns out I *do* need some semblance of structure and organisation to achieve things. So, inspired by many thousands of others and more specifically [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/), I decided to build this site, to catalog what I get done and give some my brain some structure. And for fun.

My criteria were:

* Attractive, responsive, simple, elegant design (digital vanity, what can I say).
* Ease of use - not so much of set up but to actually author posts. It had to be *easy*, otherwise I'm less inclined to do it.
* Some level of version control.
* Free. I own the domain, that should be enough dammit!

I also wanted the set up itself to be a learning experience. But I couldn't be bothered fully building the front-end and doing the CSS styling myself - hence the theme.

Jekyll and GitHub Pages was soon the obvious choice. Despite me never having used Ruby in any meaningful way, Jekyll was just *simple*.

I perused [Jekyll Themes](jekyllthemes.org) for a template to base the site on. And settled on [So Simple Theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/), for style reasons. I was pleasntly surprised by the documentation included with it from the author. I've heard it's not too hard to DIY it with bootstrap also - especially since bootstrap just added a [blog template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/).

### Overall
It was easy, enjoyable and will hopefully prove effective going with jekyll + github pages + theme + writing in markdown.

I'll see how it goes into the future before being too strong an advocate of the combo however.

Feel free to ask any questions or let me know what you think.
