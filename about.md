I'm a web/software developer from Melbourne, Australia.

I've a masters of computing (software engineering) from RMIT University and a passion for software, technology, design and the future. I was formerly an urban planner/designer at a private consultancy who left to join the tech world. I bring with me a deep knowledge of urban planning, society and politics.

> I’m passionate about web and mobile technology, and the user experience. I see a future of simple, intuitive technological integration with our lives that goes beyond what the smartphone has already achieved. I understand that a powerful technological tool is useless if it isn’t understood and enjoyed by its users.


## I have skills...

* HTML and CSS
* JavaScript, mostly client-side but I've dabbled in server-side (node.js) 
* Java
* PHP
* Front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation 
* Git
* Content Management Systems
* And all kinds of other tools, frameworks and structures that make the modern web go 'round
